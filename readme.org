#+Title: Wabot Chrome Extension

Bot under development
* Requirements
+ Webpack
+ Npm
* How to run

Clone the repository and run the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
npm install --save
#+END_SRC

Create =config.js= under the =lib= folder and follow the same format as =config_example.js=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
webpack
#+END_SRC

This will install the dependencies and also build =background.js= which is required by the chrome extension. 
Afterwards, load the directory as an unpacked extension.

* TODO Todo
- [ ] Add support for YouTube videos/ +Streamable+ / +Oddshot+ / +Instagram+
- [ ] Add more games 
- [ ] Extension UI for easier configuration
- [ ] Better logging
